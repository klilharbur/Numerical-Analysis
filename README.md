# Numerical Analysis Final Project

This project is a culmination of multiple tasks in numerical analysis, completed as part of an academic course.  
The project focuses on building core numerical methods manually using Python, without relying on pre-built solving libraries, and under strict runtime and performance constraints.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NumPy (limited)
- SciPy (limited)

## Project Scope
- **Interpolation**: Developed cubic spline interpolation for smooth approximation of sampled data.
- **Intersection Finding**: Implemented a method to detect approximate intersections between functions.
- **Numerical Integration**: Built an adaptive Simpson's rule integration method to estimate areas accurately under limited evaluations.
- **Model Fitting**: Designed a least squares fitting procedure to approximate noisy functions.
- **Area Estimation**: Created algorithms to approximate the area of 2D shapes sampled with noise, using triangulation and point sorting techniques.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Building numerical methods from scratch
- Working under runtime and sampling constraints
- Handling noisy and real-world-like data
- Optimization of algorithms for speed and accuracy

## How to Run
Each assignment is available as a separate Python file (`Assignment1.py` to `Assignment5.py`).  
Run any file individually using Python 3 to see the corresponding implementation.

## Notes
This project emphasizes clean numerical computation, manual algorithm development, and effective problem-solving techniques under realistic limitations.
